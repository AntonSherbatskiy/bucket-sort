// Validating benchmarks:
// Benchmark Program.ParallelBucketSort: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `ParallelBucketSort` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.

// Benchmark Program.SequentialSort: DefaultJob
//    * Benchmarked method `SequentialSort` is static. Benchmarks MUST be instance methods, static methods are not supported.

//    * Assembly ConsoleApp1 which defines benchmarks is non-optimized
Benchmark was built without optimization enabled (most probably a DEBUG configuration). Please, build it in RELEASE.
